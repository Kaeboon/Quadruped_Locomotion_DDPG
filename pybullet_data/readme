The pybullet_data folder contains model information about aliengo and plane.
These information is used to import the models into the PyBullet Simulation.
Model Source: https://github.com/unitreerobotics/unitree_pybullet/tree/master/data

Do not change the relative location of this directory, and the contents inside, as it would affect the code when importing the models. Thank you.
